# Geosynkronisering

## Version 1.2.3
The Subscriber.DL and Subscriber.BL has been rewritten to .net standard 2.0 for compability with .net core,
and are now used by the new core subscriper and by the Windows Application.

For better compability with .NET Standard and .NET Core:
- Changed subscriber database to SQLite from SQL server Compact.
- Updated and replaced som nuget packages.
